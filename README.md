# front-end-validation using JS

This form was built using HTML, CSS, and JS

The JavaScript does the front-end validation (i.e. client side validation):
- User has to add a correct name in the name field
- User has to add a correct email in the email field
- User has to add a correct card number in the card number field
- Card number added has to follow LUHN algorith (to make sure number inputed is a card number)
- Once a form is filled and submitted - the form is sent to my email

This project enforced my learning on JS and followed a Test Driven Development process
